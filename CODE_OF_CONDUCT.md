## Code of Conduct

The Edinburgh Kotlin User Group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the Edinburgh Kotlin User Group organisers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Edinburgh Kotlin User Group event or communication channel. Community members asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors and presenters are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.

If a community member engages in harassing behaviour, the Edinburgh Kotlin User Group organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the Edinburgh Kotlin User Group community. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a Edinburgh Kotlin User Group organiser immediately.

If you have questions or feedback about this Code of Conduct please contact one of the organisers.

Edinburgh Kotlin User Group developed this Code of Conduct to govern all Edinburgh Kotlin User Group events and communication channels. We used the [PDX Python anti-harassment policy](https://www.meetup.com/pdxpython/pages/12061872/Code_of_Conduct/) as a starting point. This Code of Conduct, like its inspiration, is licensed under the Creative Commons Zero license.
